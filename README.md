## Basic Calculator Project - Description
The Basic Calculator is a simple Python program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

The user selects an operation (+, -, *, or /).
The program performs the selected operation and displays the result.
If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program displays an error message.
## Key Features:
✔️ User-friendly input prompts
✔️ Handles different operations dynamically
✔️ Prevents division by zero errors
✔️ Provides real-time results

This project is great for beginners learning Python, user input handling, and conditional statements. 🚀
